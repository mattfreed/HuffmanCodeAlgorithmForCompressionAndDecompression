# HuffmanCodeAlgorithmForCompressionAndDecompression
Huffman code implementation for compression and decompression of text files

An executable code that implements Huffman Code algorithm. 
The program has two modes “encoding” (compressing) and
“decoding” (decompressing). 



#Encoding Mode:

• Program accepts three input parameters, e.g:

 <YourProgramName> Encode <input_file_path_to_compress> <path_of_output_file>
 
• Code compresses the file and produces the output to the given
<path_of_output_file> location 

#Decoding Mode:

• Program accepts three input parameters, e.g:

 <YourProgramName> Decode <input_file_path_to_decompress> <path_of_output_file>
 
• Code Decompress the input file and produce the output to the given
<path_of_output_file> location.
